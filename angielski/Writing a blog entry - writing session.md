## 8.
- The acting was impressive, and the plot was engaging all the way. However there may have been minor inconsistencies with the original version, meaning the book
- The running jokes together with excellent comedic writing formed a masterpiece of comedy, and even the soundtrack included comedic elements, providing an excellent background
- The reality show disappointed me strongly with its dull plot, futile attempts at comedic elements, with century-old jokes, and the most boring cast and acting.
- This drama might certainly be appealing to the younger generation. It's packed with references to modern internet culture, and its self-referential humor is targeted precisely for teenagers.
- The movie was completely inconsistent with the book, it overlooked major details, some characters and events were completely changed and turned over. Even the main character looked nothing like their description in the book.
