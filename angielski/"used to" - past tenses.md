Konstrukcji "used to" używamy by mówić zarówno o przeszłych czynnościach, jak i stanach. Natomiast konstrucji z "would" używamy tylko do opisu czynności: 

*As a child, I used to believe in ghosts*
~~As a child, I would believe in ghosts~~

*My dad used to tell ne bedtime stories.*
*My dad would tell me bedtime stories*


Czasy present continuous oraz past continuous używane są również do opisywania irytujących przyzwyczajeń:
*why are you always commenting on what the characters in the film do*

Czasu present perfect używamy również do opisania czynności które w danym momencie będzie już zakończona, zwłaszcza po wydarzaniach takich jak "when", "once", "as soon as", "the moment" itp.
